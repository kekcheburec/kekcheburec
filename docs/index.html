        <p>I'm a bit of a programmer, a bit of an engineer, and a bit of a visionary experimenter. I mostly program in
          Rust, but if necessary I can do a little in C++ 11/14 or Python 3. I also like to do all sorts of things in
          Kicad 6. I mainly used controllers from Espressif, Nordic, Raspberry Pi, ST.</p>
